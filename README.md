## 📖 How to Use These Examples

### Learning Path

We recommend following this sequence:

1. **Start with hello-agent** - Learn the basics
2. **Pick examples by interest** - Choose what's relevant to you
3. **Modify and experiment** - Best way to learn!
4. **Build your own** - Apply what you've learned

### Each Example Includes

- ✅ **Comprehensive README**: Step-by-step tutorial
- ✅ **Complete Code**: Production-ready, commented
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Standard NCP SDK layout
- ✅ **Example Interactions**: See what it does
- ✅ **Key Takeaways**: What you learned
- ✅ **Next Steps**: How to extend it

### Running an Example

```bash
# Navigate to the example
cd <example-name>

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Validate the project
ncp validate .

# Deploy to platform
ncp authenticate
ncp package .
ncp deploy <example-name>.ncp
```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Common Commands

```bash
# Validate your agent
ncp validate .

# Package for deployment
ncp package .

# Authenticate with platform
ncp authenticate

# Deploy to platform
ncp deploy <agent>.ncp

# Test interactively
ncp playground --agent <agent-name>

# Remove agent
ncp remove --agent <agent-name>
```
